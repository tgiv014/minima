meta: This is an example project. It has a description as well as it's own little page! In fact I'm going to give this one a really long description.
  maybe it even spans multiple lines! Wow this is a really long description. Why would you even really need a description this long? I guess we'll never know.
  What if we keep going? Will we wrap around the MDI icon to the left of this sentence? I sure hope we do.
